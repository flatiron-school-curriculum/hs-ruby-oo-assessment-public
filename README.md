## Ruby Object Orientation Review

![moar-ruby](http://media3.giphy.com/media/2ZrBDZDah2jjq/200.gif)

Your Ruby skills are unstoppable! Now it's time to put them to the test with some object oriented programming. 

Fork and clone this lab then follow the instructions and write your code in each of the numbered docs. Start with `1_dog.rb` and run `rspec spec/1_dog_spec.rb --fail-fast` to make sure your code is passing all the specs. Once you're done with `1_dog_spec.rb`, continue with the other tests (`2_is_between_spec.rb`, `3_fbook_user_spec.rb`, etc.).

You may need to run `bundle install` to install all of the Gems that you need.
