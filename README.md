## Ruby Object Orientation Review

![moar-ruby](http://media3.giphy.com/media/2ZrBDZDah2jjq/200.gif)

Your Ruby skills are unstoppable! Now it's time to put them to use with some object oriented programming. 

Follow the instructions and write your code in each of the numbered docs to get all the tests passing. Start with `1_dog.rb` and run `rspec spec/1_dog_spec.rb --fail-fast`. Once you're done with `1_dog_spec.rb`, continue with the other tests (`1_dog_spec.rb`, `2_fbook_user_spec.rb`, etc.)

Write your code to make the tests pass 

Run rspec `spec/level_x_spec.rb` where x is the level you want to run. Start with Level 1.

You may need to run `bundle install` to install all the Gems you need.
